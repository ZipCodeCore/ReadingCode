- **Execution Flow**: Step-by-step breakdown of program logic
- **Variations**: Different ways to solve the same problem

## Python-Specific Reading Strategies

{{< details "Embrace Python's Philosophy" >}}
Python follows "The Zen of Python" principles:
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Readability counts
- There should be one obvious way to do it
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Understand Python's Data Structures" >}}
Master Python's built-in data types:
- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable sequences for collections
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value mappings for fast lookups
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences for structured data
- **Strings**: Immutable text with rich methods
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Recognize Python Patterns" >}}
Common Python idioms and patterns:
- List comprehensions for data transformation
- Generator expressions for memory efficiency
- Context managers (with statements) for resource management
- Decorators for code enhancement
- Duck typing for flexible interfaces
